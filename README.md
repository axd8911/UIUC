# UIUC
These are all of the courses I am taking at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign to complete a Master's of Comuter Science.  Below is a brief description of what's worth looking at.  Feel free to browse throught the course directories to find the projects I worked on in each class. 

## CS410 Text Information Systems
Hwks/MPs were super basic with no real substance, but the final team project was interesting.  You may view the Gitlab repo for our project [here](https://gitlab.com/cs410-world-dam-search/dam_project). 

## CS425 Distributed Systems
This was a very challenging/rewarding course.  Please feel free to look at my Hwks and MPs as they were all very challenging and engaging.

## CS427 Software Engineering
Challenging team final project (Java/JSP web application) and some interesting MPs.

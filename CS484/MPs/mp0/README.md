# Building

To build, create a new directory, anywhere. We will call it "BLD".
Change to that directory and type

```
cmake <path_to_source_directory>
make
```
in your shell.

This will create programs named
* `BLD/bin/part1`
* `BLD/bin/part2_0`
* `BLD/bin/part2_3`

# Running the programs

You should use one of the run scripts, please follow the assignment PDF.

## Running tests

Students will not need to run the test programs in this assignment.

## Custom tests

See the documentation at [Google Test GitHub Project](https://github.com/google/googletest) .
